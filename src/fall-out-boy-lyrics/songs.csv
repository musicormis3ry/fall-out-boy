Tell That Mick He Just Made My List of Things To Do Today,Take This To Your Grave,"Light that smoke, that one for giving up on me
And one just 'cause they'll kill you sooner than my expectations
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar (to my favorite scar!)
I could have died with you
I hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle
Confess (so bury me in memory)
Now ask yourself, yeah, out on the insides
Said I loved you but I lied

Let's play this game, called "when you catch fire
I wouldn't piss to put you out"
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory, his smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home joke about the kid
You used to see and his jealousy, breaking hearts has never
Looked so cool as when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth (His teeth!)

Let's play this game, called "when you catch fire
I wouldn't piss to put you out", no
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory, his smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
So bury me in memory, his smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat

So bury me in memory around your throat"
(Coffee's For Closers),Folie a Deux,I-I-I-I can't
Explain a thing, oh
I-I-I-I want
Everything
To change and stay the same, oh
Time doesn't care about anyone or anything, oh
Come together, come apart
Only get lonely when you read the charts

And oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
Then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come, oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
No, we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand, oh

I, I'm a mascot for what
You've become
And I, I, I love the mayhem
More than the love

And oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
Then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come, oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
No, we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them 'cause I just don't care
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them 'cause I just don't care
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh, though change will come, oh, change will come

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh, change will come, oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
No, we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)
Preach electric to a microphone stand
We will never believe again! (I will never believe in anything again!)
20 Dollar Nose Bleed,Folie a Deux,Have you ever wanted to disappear?
And join a monastery, go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane? (Passenger plane)

Oh, permanent jet lag, please take me back (Please take me back)
Please take me back, oh ohh, I'm a stray dog
Sick, please let me in (Please let me in), the mad key's
Tripping, singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen, call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I wanna blow off steam
And call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in

It feels like fourteen carats, but no clarity, when I look at the
Man who would be king, the man who would be king
Goes to the desert, the same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said, "We won, oh, we won"

Permanent jet lag, please take me back (Please take me back)
Please take me back, oh ooh, I'm a stray dog
Sick, please let me in (Please let me in), the mad key's
Tripping, singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen, call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I wanna blow off steam
And call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor (ooh), don't let the doctor in (ooh)

Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, bla bla bla Benzedrine
Ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, ahh
Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, bla bla bla Benzedrine
Ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, ahh

Only one book really matters, the rest
Of the proof is on the television, on the

Woo! Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I want to blow off steam
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in, oh, uh huh, ooh

Have you ever wanted to disappear?

It's not me, it's you
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Untie the balloons from around my neck
And ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me, I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring, and the kids are snoring
And my ego's in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing
And I said... I said!
27,Folie a Deux,If home is where the heart is, then we're all just fucked
I can't remember
I can't remember
And I want it so bad
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember
The good old days

And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard
Just feels like a curse

My mind is a safe
And if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you

The m-m-milligrams in my head
Burning tobacco in the wind
Chasing the direction
Chasing the direction you went
You're a bottled star
The planets align, you're just like Mars
You shine in the sky
You shine in the sky

Are all the good times getting gone?
They come, and go, and go, and come, and go, oh yeah
I've got a lot of friends who are stars
But some are just black holes

My mind is a safe
And if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you, oh

And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard
Just feels like a curse

My mind is a safe
And if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you

If home is where the heart is, then we're all just fucked
7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen),From Under The Cork Tree,I'm sleeping my way out of this one
With anyone who will lie down
I'll be stuck fixated on one star
When the world is crashing down

I keep telling myself, I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself, I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type

Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own

The only thing worse than not knowing
Is you thinking that I don't know
I'm having another episode
I just need a stronger dose

I keep telling myself, I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself, keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type

Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own

Ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra
Ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra, doo, doo, doo
Ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra
Ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra, doo, doo, doo

I keep telling myself, I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds

I keep telling myself, keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type

Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own
